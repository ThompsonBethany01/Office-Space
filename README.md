## About The Project
As an employee at Initech, I've got a bad case of the *Mondays*. Could you do me a favor? The worst that could happen is we get put into a white-collar, minimum-security resort (I heard they have conjugal visits). Pinky promise!  
### Goals
My friend Michael says...

> I always do that. I always mess up some mundane detail."
